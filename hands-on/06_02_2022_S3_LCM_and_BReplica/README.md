Click save
```


## Part 2 - Creating Source and Destination S3 Bucket

### Step 1 - Create Source Bucket with Static Website

- Open S3 Service from AWS Management Console.

- Create a bucket of `source.replica.clarusway` with following properties,

```text
Region                      : us east-1 (N.Virginia)
Block all public access     : UNCHECKED (PUBLIC)
Versioning                  : ***ENABLE***
Tagging                     : 0 Tags
Default encryption          : Disabled
Object lock                 : Disabled

PS: Please, do not forget to select "US East (N.Virginia)" as Region
```

- Click the S3 bucket `source.replica.clarusway` and upload following files.

```text
index.html
cat.jpg
```

- Click `Properties` >> `Static Website Hosting` and put checkmark to `Use this bucket to host a website` and enter `index.html` as default file.


- Set the static website bucket policy as shown below (`PERMISSIONS` >> `BUCKET POLICY`) and change `bucket-name` with your own bucket.

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::DON'T FORGET TO CHANGE ME/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

- Open static website URL in browser and show it is working.

### Step 2 - Create Destination Bucket

- Create a new bucket named `destination.cross.region.replica.clarusway` with following properties.

```text
Region                    : us-east-2 (**Ohio)
Allow all public access   : UNCHECKED (PUBLIC)
Versioning                : ***ENABLED***
Tagging                   : 0 Tags
Default encryption        : Disabled
Object lock               : Disabled


PS: Please, do not forget to select "US East (Ohio)" as Region
```

- Click `Properties` >> `Static Web Hosting` and put checkmark to `Use this bucket to host a website` and enter `index.html` as default file.

- Set the static website bucket policy as shown below (`PERMISSIONS` >> `BUCKET POLICY`) and change `bucket-name` with your own bucket..

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::don't forget to change me/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Part 3 - Creating IAM Role for Bucket Replication

- Go to `destination.cross.region.replica.clarusway` bucket, copy `Endpoint` and paste to browser.

- Show the website is replicated from source bucket.

## Part 5 - Configuring (Tag and Prefix) Bucket Replica

### Step 1 - Configuring with Prefix

- Go to S3 bucket on AWS Console

- Select `source.replica.clarusway`.

- Create a folder named `kitten`.

- Select `Management` >> `Replication rules` >> `Create replication rule`

```text
a. Replication Rule Name:           : Prefixrule
b. Status                           : Enable
c. Source Bucket                    : 
   - Choose a rule scope as "Limit the scope of this rule usingone or more filters"
   - Prefix                         : kitten
   - tag                            : keep it as is
d. Destination                      : 
   - Choose a bucket in this account
   - Bucket name : destination.cross.region.replica.clarusway
e. IAM role                         : yourname.cross.replicationiam.   role
f. Encryption                       : Unchecked
g. check Storage class and select "One zone IA"

h. Additional Replication options   : Leave it as is

Review and click save
```

- Show that there are two rules.

- Select `Replication rules ` >> Select previous rule click `Action` >> `Disable Rule`

### Step 2 - Testing (Prefix)

- Go to `source.replica.clarusway` bucket and upload `outside_folder.txt`.

- Go to `destination.cross.region.replica.clarusway` bucket and show that the`outside_folder.txt` is not replicated in the bucket.

- This time go to `source.replica.clarusway` bucket >> `kitten` folder and upload `inside_kitten_folder.txt`.

- Go to `destination.cross.region.replica.clarusway` bucket show that `kitten` folder has been replicated automatically due to replication rule and inside the folder there is `inside_kitten_folder.txt file`.

### Step 3 - Configuring with tag

- Go to S3 bucket on AWS Console

- Select `source.replica.clarusway`.

- Select `Management` >> `Replication rules` >> `Create replication rule`

```text
a. Replication Rule Name:           : Tagrule
b. Status                           : Enable
c. Source Bucket                    : 
   - Choose a rule scope as "Limit the scope of this rule usingone or more filters"
   - Prefix                         : keep it as is
   - tag                            : Key: Name --- Value: cat
d. Destination                      : 
   - Choose a bucket in this account
   - Bucket name : destination.cross.region.replica.clarusway
e. IAM role                         : yourname.cross.replicationiam.   role
f. Encryption                       : Unchecked
g. check Storage class and select "One zone IA"
g. Destination Storage Class        : Unchecked
h. Additional Replication options   : Leave it as is

Review and click save
```
- Show that there are three rules and the first created is disabled.

### Step 2 - Testing (Tag)

- Go to `source.replica.clarusway` bucket and direct upload `tag_file.txt`.

- Go to `destination.cross.region.replica.clarusway` bucket and show that the `tag_file.txt` is not replicated in the bucket.

- This time go to `source.replica.clarusway` bucket, and upload the `tag_file.txt` file with tag as `key:name` and `value:cat`;

```text
1. Select Add files
    - upload tag_file.txt from local

2. Additional upload options
    - Storage class Standart-IA
    - Tags
        Key     : Name
        Value   : cat
    and click save button
3. Review and upload
```

- Go to `destination.cross.region.replica.clarusway` bucket show that the `tag_file.txt` file is replicated.
