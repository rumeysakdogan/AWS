DB parameter group & option group : default
Automatic backups                 : enable
Backup retention period           : 7 days (Explain how)

Select window for backup to show snapshots
Monitoring  : Unchecked
Log exports : Unchecked

Maintenance
  - Enable auto minor version upgrade: Enabled (Explain what minor and major upgrade are)
  - Maintenance window (be careful not to overlap maintenance and backup windows)

Deletion protection: *Enabled
```

- Estimated monthly costs
Show that when you select `production` instead of `Free Tier Template` it charges you.

- Click `Create Database` button

- Go to database menu and select `RDS-mysql` database and show and explain sub-sections (Connectivity & Security, Monitoring etc.)

- Show the Automatic backup also.

- Show Modify button

- Show action button (restore,take snapshots, etc.)

## Part 2 - Configuring MySQL Workbench to connect to the RDS Instance

- First, go to the Amazon RDS Service, select `Database` section from the left-hand menu, click databases and select `RDS-mysql`. Then, copy the `endpoint` at the bottom of the page.

- Open the MySQL Workbench and click `+` to configure a new MySQL connection.

On the page opened, we'll set up a new connection:

```text
1. Connection Name   : first connection.

2. Host Name         : Paste the endpoint of the database that you have copied 
                       and leave the port as is, 3306

3. Username          : Here we enter the user name that we determined while creating the DB instance.
                       So we enter "admin" as a username.

4. Password          : Click the `Store in Keychain/Vault` and enter the password 
                       that you determined as "Pl123456789" while creating the DB Instance.

5. Test Connection   : Before you connect DB Instance, test the connection whether it works properly.
                       So, click `Test Connection` tab.

6. If the connection is set properly, you'll see the successfully message

7. Then click `OK` to complete the configuration
```

## Part 3 - Manipulating RDS Instance

- Show `clarusway` database that is created together with RDS DB instance creation.

- Create a new database from "Schema" tab

- To modify the database, first, we need to create a new table. So, click the `clarusway` schema (or your schema's name). Right-click the `Table` option, then select the `Create Table`, and enter `Personal_Info_1` as table name.

```text
1. First Row: Type `ID_number` into the first line. 
              ID number is an integer, so the system automatically assign Integer value to the Datatype column.
              Explain the Primary Key, choose the ID_number as a Primary Key, and check the PK box.

3. Second Row: type Name into the second row.VARCHAR(45)

4. Third Row: type Surname into the third row.VARCHAR(45)

5. Fourth Row: type Gender into the fourth row.VARCHAR(45)

6. Fifth Row : type Salary into the fifth row.VARCHAR(45)

After that click `Apply` at the bottom of the row.

Then a window that shows the review of the table pops up on the screen. Click Apply, if it's OK.
```
- Add another table via SQL command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `clarusway`.`Personal_Info_2` (
  `ID_number` INT NOT NULL,
  `Name` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `Surname` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `Gender` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  `Age` INT NULL,
  `Department` VARCHAR(45) NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ID_number`));
```

- Then refresh the "Table" tab to see newly created tables 

- Add data to the "Personal_Info" table as shown below:

```sql
INSERT INTO clarusway.Personal_Info_1
(ID_number, Name, Surname, Gender, Salary)
VALUES
('1234','Osvaldo','Clarusway','Male','40000'), 
('56789','Guile','Clarusway','Male','50000'), 
('007','Charlie','Clarusway','Male','45000'), 
('432','Marcus','Clarusway','Male','50000'), 
('324','Vincenzo','Clarusway','Male','60000'), 
('43546','Serdar','Clarusway','Male','65000');
```

- Write a query to show all data in the `Personal_Info_1` table

```sql
SELECT * FROM clarusway.Personal_Info_1;
```

- Write a query to show the personal whose salary are higher than 40K in the `Personal_Info_1` table

```sql
 SELECT * FROM clarusway.Personal_Info_1 WHERE salary > 40000;
```




- Try to delete RDS and show that RDS instance can not be deleted because of the `Deletion Protection`.

- Modify DB instance for "Disabling Deletion Protection"

- Try to delete RDS and show that RDS instance again.

   -Show that "Create final snapshot?" option should be "Unchecked"
       
              "I acknowledge...." flag is "Checked"

 - Type "delete me" nad Click "Delete".

 - Show that Automated Backups are deleted also.
